# Hi there 👋

## 🙋‍ What is AiroBot?
AiroBot is a project originally founded by three German developers who are tired of seeing discord servers with 20 different bots. We want to offer a Discord bot with all imaginable features. A comprehensive management dashboard including management app should not be missing.

## 🌈 Contribution
If you are interested in contributing to AiroBot, you can easily do so via a pull request in our open source projects. If you would like to work directly in our team, then have a look at our [Discord](https://discord.gg/Mwa2WYVGwY), where you will find more information.

## 👩‍💻 Useful resources
In general, we keep many projects private. However, we also try to offer some support to the developer community and intend to make individual projects publicly available under specified licenses.
